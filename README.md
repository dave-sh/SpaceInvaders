# GatorInvaders
## Introduction
This was my final project for my Digital Art class and involved the development of a 2D game engine using the Java Swing library. Key features include using Swing to render graphics, user interaction through keyboard and mouse input handling, object scripting, and the utilization of custom game sprites to visually represent various in-game elements. The overall framework also includes collision detection mechanisms and provided a platform for creating interactive 2D games with Java.
